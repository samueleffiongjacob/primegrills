A POS system for handling in-store orders, transactions, and payments.  

## **Folder Structure**  

```bash

â”‚â”€â”€ public/                # Public assets (favicon, images) 
â”‚â”€â”€ .env                   # Environment variables  
â”‚â”€â”€ package.json           # Dependencies & scripts

```

### **Setup & Start**  

```bash
cd PrimeGrillsPOS  
npm install  
npm run dev  
```

This system consists of two interfaces:  

1. *Merchant POS Screen* â€“ This is where the restaurant or store staff add items to a customerâ€™s order. It fetches products from an API hosted on *host* and updates the order in real-time.  
2. *Customer Display Screen* â€“ This screen shows the current order to the customer as items are added.  

## **How It Works**  

- The **Merchant POS** loads available products from a backend API.  
- When the merchant adds an item to an order, the system updates instantly.  
- The **Customer Display** receives these updates through **WebSockets**, ensuring the customer sees the order changes in real-time.  
- Both screens stay in sync as long as the POS is active.  

This setup ensures a **seamless checkout experience** similar to what you see in modern **fast-food chains and retail stores**.

The app is built modularly, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and performance optimization. ðŸš€
